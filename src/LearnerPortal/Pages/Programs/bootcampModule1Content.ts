We'll explore both the front-end and back-end components of modern web development — from creating user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to building scalable backends with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB." , "You’ll learn how these layers communicate through APIs and understand the full architecture of a web app — how a user’s request moves through the system and returns a result. Visual diagrams and practical walkthroughs will help you grasp the flow and responsibility of each part." , "We’ll also guide you in setting up your development environment with VS Code, Node.js, and Git. You’ll create your first Express server and learn how version control works with GitHub — essential tools for your development journey. This module is all about building the right foundation. By the end, you’ll be ready to start coding with confidence, having taken your first real step into full stack development.",
